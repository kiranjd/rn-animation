Visualizing and implementing animations in React Native using Animated API

## This is project is using:

- Typescript - WIP

## Why?
This project is a visual development area for implementing animations in React Native. Using Storybook, which enables faster development and great DX(yay!).

## How?
Develop animations preferrably using Animated of React Native to better understand how to put the pieces together(and to make changes to native if required)

Find a existing or new animation and plan, execute how to go about implementing it. Feel free make an issue with visuals of animation(GIF or an image).
